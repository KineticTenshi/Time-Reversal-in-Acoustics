# Time Reversal in Acoustics

This repository explores the concept of **time-reversal in wave propagation**, with a focus on acoustic waves. The numerical simulations aim to illustrate how a recorded wave can be reversed in time and re-emitted to refocus at its original source location.

This is a project completed using Python in a Jupyter notebook (Google Colab), as part of a university course in numerical methods.

## Project Summary

Time-reversal techniques are used in acoustics and other wave-based fields (e.g., seismology, ultrasonics) to reconstruct past events or focus energy at precise spatial points. This notebook:

- Simulates 1D acoustic wave propagation in a homogeneous medium
- Implements a finite difference scheme for the wave equation
- Demonstrates how time-reversing a signal at the boundary allows spatial refocusing
- Includes animations and visualizations of wave dynamics
